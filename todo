TODO in near future:
- Fetch texts from an API instead of hardcoded (maybe https://goquotes.docs.apiary.io/# ?)
- Fix issue where a new word creates a space at beginning of the input field
- Fix issue where wrong letter results in all red text
- Fix logic issues, e.g. when input doesn't get counted
- Set interval to 3 seconds instead 1 second 

TODO in late future:
- Add multiplayer mode (WebSockets, Socket.io, etc.)
- GitHub Authentication?
- Highscore for the day?
